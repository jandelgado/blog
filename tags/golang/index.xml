Background The current release candidate of go 1.21 adds an experimental port of the Web Assembly System Interface (WASI). While the go compiler could compile to WASM before, only the Javascript target was supported, which was targeting browsers.
WASI enables a WASM application to access operating-system features like files and sockets, while being independet of browsers.</description></item><item><title>Go generics released</title><link>https://jandelgado.github.io/blog/posts/golang-generics-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:03:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jandelgado.github.io/blog/posts/golang-generics-released/</guid><description>Today a first official beta version of go 1.18 was released, which introduces generics to the Go language. This is the most significant change to the language since the release of Go 1. However, it is a backwards compatible change, meaning old code should compile without changes.
Before the release of the 1.18 beta version, you had to compile the go compiler from source in order to experiment with generics. That&amp;rsquo;s now easier, just download the new version here, look in the &amp;ldquo;unstable&amp;rdquo; section.</description></item></channel></rss>
